## Overview

This assessment consists of two projects: a Portfolio Website and a Color-Changing Clock Background. The goal is to use AI prompts to assist in building these web applications. Below are the details for each project, including the requirements and instructions.

## Project 1: Portfolio Website

- Projects
- Contact

### Requirements

1. **Home Page**: Welcome message with a brief introduction.
2. **About Me**: A section to describe yourself, your skills, and your background.
3. **Projects**: Display your projects with descriptions and links to the code or live versions.
4. **Contact**: Provide a form or email link for visitors to contact you.
5. **Navigation Bar**: Include a navigation bar to switch between the sections.
6. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the website is responsive and works on different screen sizes.

### Instructions

1. **Setup**: Create the HTML structure for the website.
2. **Style**: Use CSS to style the website.
3. **JavaScript**: Add interactivity if needed, such as a smooth scroll for the navigation.
4. **Hosting**: Deploy the website using a service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.


### Description

Create a web application that displays the current time and changes the background color based on the time of day. The background color should change gradually.

### Requirements

1. **HTML Structure**: Create the basic HTML structure for the clock.
2. **CSS Styling**: Style the clock and background color.
3. **JavaScript Functionality**: Implement the logic to display the current time and change the background color.
4. **Color Selection**: Allow users to choose from a set of predefined colors for the background.

### Instructions

1. **Setup**: Create the HTML structure for the clock.
2. **Style**: Use CSS to style the clock and background.
3. **JavaScript**: Write the JavaScript to update the clock every second and change the background color.
4. **Color Selection**: Add functionality for users to select a background color from swatches.



## Using AI Prompts

To build these projects, you can use AI to assist you with code generation, troubleshooting, and design suggestions. Here are some example prompts:

- **HTML Structure**: "Give me the HTML code for a personal portfolio website with sections for Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact."
- **CSS Styling**: "Provide CSS code to style a navigation bar and make the website responsive."
- **JavaScript Functionality**: "How can I create a JavaScript function to update a clock every second and change the background color based on the time of day?"
- **Color Selection**: "Give me the code for a color picker that allows users to choose a background color from a set of predefined colors."

## Submission

Submit the following:

1. The code for both projects.
2. A link to the deployed portfolio website.
3. Screenshots of the working Color-Changing Clock Background.

Good luck with your projects!
